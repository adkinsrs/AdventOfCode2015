This is just a copy and paste of the instructions for each day.  

All of these will have the answer revealed, since I will have already completed both problems for the day.

All references for puzzle input can be found in the 'files' directory

I'm noting the instructions because I'm not sure if they will be archived or not and I'd rather have a copy in case I'd like to revisit the puzzles again (maybe in a different language, for example)
